Hello to PopcornPicker
A movie rating application/library which contains saved movies from the OMDb movie database.

# installation
clone the repository and run the main.py file

# usage
The app explains itself. 
to run the Terminal Version of the app you must run this command in the main folder of the terminal.
      python3 main.py <anything>.json
      or
      python3 main.py <anything>.csv
depending on which data file you would like use.

you will be given options in the terminal follow the instructions and enjoy the ease of using the app :) 

In order to run the Streamlit Version you must run this command in your terminal from the main project folder. In my case I am in the pythonMovieProject directory.
      streamlit run streamlitify/ðŸŽ¥_Homepage.py
